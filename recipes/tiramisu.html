    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>A classic Italian dessert that blends cocoa, coffee, and mascarpone into something refreshing and balanced. It's sweet, but not <em>too</em> sweet!</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pound of mascarpone (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of strong brewed coffee (room temperature)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of rum</li>
        <li>2 3-ounce packages of ladyfinger cookies</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a medium saucepan until well-blended. Whisk in the milk and cook it all over medium heat (while still stirring) until the mixture comes to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil it gently for 1 minute before removing it from the heat and letting it cool a bit before tightly covering it and setting it to chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Beat the cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Remove the egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator. Add in the mascarpone and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Combine the coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split the ladyfingers in half (lengthwise) and drizzle them with the coffee mixture. Arrange half of them in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread half of the whipped cream on top. Repeat those layers one more time.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cocoa powder on top, then cover the dish and refrigerate it for about 4 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>It's ready! Enjoy!</li>
