    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups of water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 pounds of salmon fillets</li>
        <li>1 medium green onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 1/4 cup of cold water with cornstarch in a small bowl with a lid. Seal the bowl and shake it until the cornstarch is fully dissolved and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the remaining cup of water with the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it's brought to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer before stirring in the cornstarch mixture. Keep simmering for about 5 minutes so the sauce can thicken, then take it off the heat and set aside 1/2 cup of the glaze you just made.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's boiler to low. Place your salmon on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush all sides of it with some of your remaining glaze.</li>
        <li>Broil the salmon for 12 minutes, then brush that 1/2 cup of glaze over the top. Turn the broiler up to high and broil for about 3 minutes or until the salmon flakes easily. Garnish it with the green onion and sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
