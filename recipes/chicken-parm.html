    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless and boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>A cup of panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of mozzarella cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped basil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of grated provolone</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F.</li>
        <li>Cover the chicken breasts with plastic and use a mallet to thin them down to about half an inch.</li>
        <li>Use salt and pepper to season the chicken, then coat both sides in flour.</li>
        <li>Beat the two eggs and set those aside in their bowl. Mix the panko and Parmesan in a separate bowl, then set that aside. Now dip each chicken breast first in the eggs, then in the panko mixture, before letting them rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat up some olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat, then cook the chicken breasts in it for roughly two minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Move the chicken over to a baking tray or dish before topping them each with 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce and the mozzarella, basil, and provolone. Drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil as well.</li>
        <li>Bake the chicken in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until they hit an internal temperature of 165°F. Let the chicken rest briefly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
